# diGRASS — Bachelor Thesis Code

This repository contains the main Python script used in my bachelor thesis to run **directed graph spectral sparsification (diGRASS)** and generate the plots reported in the thesis. Input graphs are provided as GraphML files in `examples/`.

## Citing

This code implements the diGRASS method from:

Y. Zhang, Z. Zhao, and Z. Feng, “Directed Graph Spectral Sparsification via Spectrum-Preserving Symmetrization,”
ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 2024.

### Reference implementation (MATLAB)

This Python script was implemented with reference to the following MATLAB code:

web1799, **directed_graph_sparsification** (GitHub repository).
